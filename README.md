# Logistic Regression Model for Analyzing Vulnerability to Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemic
## Description
This `Logistic_regression.ipynb` Logistic Regression Model for Analyzing Vulnerability to Anxiety during the COVID-19 Pandemicfile serves the purpose of processing a Logistic Regression model using Machine Learning components. The primary objective of the analysis is to identify the most vulnerable individuals likely to experience anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the challenge of imbalanced dependent variables, the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) method for oversampling was employed. The dataset was then divided into train and test subsets. Finally, the analysis culminates in the creation of a confusion matrix and an ROC curve.

## Purpose
The main goal of this analysis is to utilize a Logistic Regression model to assess the susceptibility of individuals to feelings of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. By leveraging Machine Learning techniques, we aim to identify factors and characteristics that contribute to vulnerability. The ultimate objective is to gain insights into the population's mental health and inform strategies for providing appropriate support.

## Methodology
The following steps were undertaken to accomplish the analysis:

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Data cleaning and preparation for model input.
- Handling imbalanced dependent variables using the SMOTE oversampling technique.
2. Model Development:
- Training a Logistic Regression model using the preprocessed data.
- Utilizing appropriate Machine Learning components for model construction.
3. Model Evaluation:
- Splitting the dataset into train and test subsets for performance assessment.
- Generating a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy.
- Creating an ROC curve to assess the model's discriminative ability.

## Requirements
Ensure that the following dependencies are installed to successfully execute the Logistic Regression analysis:
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- statsmodels

## Usage
To replicate the Logistic Regression analysis for vulnerability to anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and libraries are installed as specified in the project's requirements file.
2. Run the provided code or script to preprocess the dataset and apply the SMOTE oversampling technique to handle imbalanced dependent variables.
3. Train the Logistic Regression model using the preprocessed data and appropriate Machine Learning components.
4. Split the dataset into train and test subsets to evaluate the model's performance.
5. Generate a confusion matrix to assess the model's predictive accuracy, highlighting true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
6. Create an ROC curve to evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between vulnerable and non-vulnerable individuals.
7. Analyze the results, considering the model's performance metrics and the shape of the ROC curve.
8. Draw conclusions and insights regarding vulnerability to anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic based on the analysis.
